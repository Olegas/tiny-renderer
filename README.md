# TinyRenderer

This is a JavaScript implementation of brilliant [Tiny Renderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) by [Dmitry "ssloy" Sokolov](https://github.com/ssloy)

This is not a production-ready code. It is done with educational purposes.

This demo renders 3D object from *.obj file to the canvas using only "put pixel" operation
(using putImageData for bulk operations). All other things is performed "by hand".
